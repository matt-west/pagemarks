PageMarks is an extension for Google Chrome that allows you to save your place in a webpage so that you can come back and finish reading it later.
The extension is currently under development.

There are plans to add offline support in the future so that you can read pages on the go.

TODO LIST:
* Add new pagemarks from context menu
* Delete pagemarks from the popup view
* Add delete function to database handler
